Extends CMB2--create WordPress options pages with multiple metaboxes,
support for tabs, and flexible menu locations.

== Description ==

CMB2 Metatabs Options (CMO) is a plugin for developers using CMB2 to manage metaboxes and fields.
CMO makes it easy to create options pages with multiple metaboxes--and optional WordPress admin tabs.
You can attach your option page(s) to any existing Wordpress menu or add them as a new
top-level menu.

This plugin requires the [CMB2 Plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/cmb2/), or your project
must already utilize the [CMB2](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2) library. CMB2 is *not* included.

Please see the wiki at CMO's github repository for a detailed user's guide:

Thanks to the folks maintaining CMB2 for their continued development of CMB2 and the
starting point for this plugin.
